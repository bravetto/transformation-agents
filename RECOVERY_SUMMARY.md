## 🛠️ Recovery Actions Taken

### TypeScript Fixes
- Updated utils.test.ts to match actual exports from utils.ts
- Fixed animation-utils.test.ts to correctly type usePageVisibility
- Added missing methods and properties to ChatIntegration class
- Fixed type conversion issues in test files

### "use client" Directive Fixes
- Standardized all directives to use double quotes
- Fixed duplicate directives in 129 files
- Added missing directive to 1 file
- Created scripts to detect and fix directive issues

### Dynamic Import Standardization
- Created consistent loading state components
- Applied standard pattern to 6 files with dynamic imports
- Improved loading state visuals with animation
- Added proper error handling for dynamic imports

### Error Boundary Implementation
- Added error boundaries to critical components (AnimationProvider, Analytics)
- Added error boundaries to dynamically imported components
- Created templates and tools for implementing error boundaries
- Implemented proper error reporting for boundary-wrapped components

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Continue Error Boundary Implementation**
   - Prioritize remaining components by importance
   - Focus on user-facing components first
   - Implement error boundaries for all page components

2. **Fix Build Warnings**
   - Address React Hook dependency warnings
   - Resolve ESLint issues in remaining files

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Run all tests and identify failures
   - Fix failing tests
   - Increase test coverage for critical components

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Refactor large components (6 components over 500 lines)
   - Optimize animation performance
   - Implement code splitting for large pages

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Consistent Patterns Matter**
   - Standardizing patterns like "use client" directives and dynamic imports makes maintenance easier
   - Using error boundaries consistently improves application resilience

2. **Automated Tooling**
   - Created scripts to detect and fix common issues
   - Implemented daily health check script for ongoing monitoring

3. **Incremental Improvement**
   - Fixed issues in order of priority
   - Made small, focused changes to avoid introducing new issues
