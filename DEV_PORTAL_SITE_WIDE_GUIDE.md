## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### User Experience Flow
```
Before: Konami → Button appears → User must find & click → Modal opens
Now:    Konami → Celebration! → Auto-open modal → Button for future use
```

### Visual Hierarchy
- Celebration overlay uses z-[10000] (temporary)
- Modal uses z-[9999] (always on top)
- Button uses z-[9998] (below modal, above content)
- Other components remain at z-50 or below

### State Management
- `dev-portal-unlocked`: Persistent unlock state
- `dev-portal-seen`: Tracks if user has seen the portal
- First-time users get auto-open experience
- Returning users get the floating button
