## 📋 **THE TRINITY SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **🧠 Core Intelligence Layer**
```
.cursorrules                           # Master Control (400 lines)
├── .cursor/rules/ai-efficiency.md     # AI Patterns & Tech Stack (200 lines)
├── .cursor/rules/design-system.md     # Visual & Conversion Rules (300 lines)
└── .cursor/rules/development-workflow.md # Shipping Protocols (250 lines)
```

**Total System**: 1,150 lines of pure AI efficiency vs. the bloated 9,000+ word chaos we replaced.
