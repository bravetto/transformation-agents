# üïäÔ∏è RADICAL TRANSPARENCY DESIGN SYSTEM
## THE BRIDGE PROJECT - TRUTH IN LIGHT

### ü§ç **DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: NAKED IN THE LIGHT**

We're not hiding. We're not pretending. We're standing in absolute truth.
- **Zero graduates?** That's our starting line, not our shame.
- **No proven outcomes?** That's our opportunity, not our weakness.
- **Building in public?** That's our superpower, not our vulnerability.

### üí° **NEW COLOR SYSTEM: COMFORT IN TRUTH**

```scss
// Primary Palette - Light as Truth
$pure-white: #FFFFFF;         // Absolute transparency
$comfort-cream: #FEFDF8;      // Warm embrace of truth
$soft-cloud: #F9FAFB;         // Gentle support
$moon-glow: #F3F4F6;          // Subtle depth without shadows

// Accent Colors - Hope Without Pretense
$hope-gold: #F59E0B;          // Accessible, warm gold
$courage-blue: #2563EB;       // Trust and stability
$growth-green: #10B981;       // Transformation in progress

// Grounding Colors - Readable Reality
$gentle-charcoal: #374151;    // Primary text (7.5:1 on white)
$soft-shadow: #6B7280;        // Secondary text (4.8:1 on white)
$whisper-gray: #9CA3AF;       // Tertiary elements (3:1 on white)
```

### üéØ **PRIORITIZED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### üèóÔ∏è **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

  --text-primary: #374151;
  --text-secondary: #6B7280;
  --accent: #F59E0B;

}

// Component Updates
.hero {
  background: var(--bg-primary);

.truth-badge {
  background: var(--bg-secondary);
  border: 2px solid var(--accent);
  color: var(--text-primary);
