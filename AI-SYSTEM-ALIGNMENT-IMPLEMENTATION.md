## 🛠 IMPLEMENTATION COMPONENTS

### 1. AI Prompt Validation System (`scripts/ai-prompt-validation-system.ts`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive validation of AI-generated code against architectural patterns

**Key Features**:
- **Chain-of-Verification Implementation**: 4-step validation process
- **Architectural Pattern Matching**: Validates against Next.js 15.4.3 patterns
- **Context Drift Detection**: Monitors semantic and architectural drift
- **Self-Correction Mechanisms**: Automated issue resolution for high-confidence problems

**Validation Rules**:
```typescript
// Mission Context Alignment
validator: (code, context) => {
  const hasMissionContext = /july.?28|freedom|jahmere|divine/i.test(code);
  const isAppRoute = context.filePath.includes('app/');
  
  if (isAppRoute && !hasMissionContext) {
    return {
      message: 'App route missing mission context alignment',
      suggestions: ['Add mission-relevant context', 'Include July 28th deadline awareness'],
      confidence: 0.7
    };
  }
  return null;
}
```

**Chain-of-Verification Steps**:
1. **Functional Correctness**: Does code meet requirements?
2. **Architectural Compliance**: Follows project patterns?

**Neural Howlround Formula** (Based on Research Paper):
```typescript
// Attenuation function implementing research-based formula
const betaDynamic = globalTuning.theta * (
  exponentialDecay.tau * Math.exp(-gamma * maxSalience) +
  phiFunction(maxSalience) +
  logarithmicDamping.tau * Math.log(1 + maxSalience)
);

// Apply attenuation to prevent lock-in
const newSalience = salience * (1 - betaDynamic);
```
