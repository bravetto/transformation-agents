## 💫 The Vision

> "What if we tried something different? What if instead of warehousing human potential, we developed it? What if accountability meant building someone up instead of breaking them down?"

This project represents hope - hope that our justice system can evolve, that communities can heal, and that every person deserves a chance to bridge the gap between who they were and who they can become.
