   - Floating terminal button
   - Dark glass-morphic modal
   - Categorized route registry
   - Error boundary integration

2. **Layout Integration** (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
   - DevPortalProvider wrapped around app content
   - Placed inside AnimationProvider for proper context

3. **Hidden Routes Created**
   - `/test-logo-assets` - Logo & asset testing
   - `/test-animations` - Animation test suite with replay
   - `/test-components` - Component library showcase
   - `/admin/analytics` - Analytics dashboard
   - `/admin/settings` - System settings with tabs
