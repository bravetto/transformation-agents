## Overview

The Bridge Project website has been reorganized to provide a more streamlined user experience while still providing all the valuable content that users need. This document outlines the content organization strategy implemented across the site.

## Content Architecture

### Homepage (/)

- **Content**: 
  - Hero section with clear messaging
  - Problem/Solution summary (73% recidivism vs Bridge alternative)
  - Proposal to Judge Ferrero
  - Call-to-Action section
  - Navigation to deeper content pages
- **Design**: Centered content, optimized typography, fast loading (<2 seconds)

### The Case (/the-case)
- **Purpose**: Provide comprehensive information about JAHmere's situation
- **Content**:
  - Overview tab - Problem/solution comparison
  - Timeline tab - Key events in chronological order
  - Program tab - Bridge Project details and requirements
  - Legal Context tab - Legal framework and options
- **Design**: Tabbed interface for easy navigation, consistent with global design system

### Impact Dashboard (/impact)
- **Purpose**: Show real-time community support and impact metrics
- **Content**:
  - Summary metrics (supporters, letters, shares)
  - Progress toward goal visualization
  - Geographic distribution of support
  - Weekly growth chart
  - Live activity feed
- **Design**: Data visualization components, real-time updates, engaging animations

### Jordan Dungy Page (/people/jordan-dungy)
- **Purpose**: Highlight Jordan Dungy's testimony and connection to JAHmere
- **Content**:
  - Personal connection narrative
  - Animated sections from homepage
  - Video testimony placeholder

- **Design**: Visually engaging, consistent with people section design

## Navigation Strategy

1. **Main Navigation**:
   - Home
   - The Case
   - Impact Dashboard
   - People
   - Contact

2. **Homepage Explore Section**:
   - Visually engaging cards linking to the three key content pages
   - Clear descriptions of what users will find on each page

3. **Cross-Page Navigation**:
   - Each page includes CTA section linking to other relevant pages
   - "Back to Home" links on all deep content pages

## Design Principles

- **Centered Content**: All pages use the `.page-container` and `.content-center` classes
- **Consistent Spacing**: `.section-spacing` provides consistent vertical rhythm
- **Typography**: Proper heading hierarchy with responsive sizes
- **Card-Based Layout**: Consistent card components for content organization
- **Animations**: Subtle animations enhance the experience without overwhelming

## Mobile Optimization

- All pages are fully responsive
- Mobile-first design with appropriate breakpoints
- Simplified navigation on mobile devices
- Stack layout on smaller screens for readability

## Performance Considerations

- Heavy animations moved from homepage to dedicated pages
- Optimized image loading
- Component-based architecture for code splitting
- Minimal dependencies where possible
