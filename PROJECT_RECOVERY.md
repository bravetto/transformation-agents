## 🤖 AI COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

### Session Starter Template
```
🌉 BRIDGE PROJECT - RECOVERY MODE ACTIVE

Current Status: Phase 1, Day 1
Active Task: [specific issue from recovery dashboard]
Scope Check: ✅ Read .cursor/rules/project-scope.mdc

Rules:
1. ONLY fix existing issues listed in PROJECT_RECOVERY.md
2. NO new features, improvements, or enhancements
3. NO refactoring beyond necessary fixes
4. ASK before suggesting anything not in current task
5. VALIDATE with build test after each change

Ready to proceed with minimal, focused fixes only.
```

### Feature Rejection Script
```
❌ OUT OF SCOPE - RECOVERY MODE ACTIVE

That suggestion is outside our current recovery scope.
We're only fixing existing issues until all errors are resolved.

Current focus: [specific issue from PROJECT_RECOVERY.md]
Please provide a minimal fix for this issue only.

Check PROJECT_RECOVERY.md for approved tasks.
```

### Complexity Rejection Script
```
🛑 TOO COMPLEX - MINIMAL FIX NEEDED

That approach is too complex for recovery mode.
Show me the simplest possible fix for this specific error.

Requirements:
- No refactoring
- No optimization
- No "improvements"
- Just fix the error

What's the minimal change needed?
```

## 🆘 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Build Completely Breaks
```bash
# Emergency rollback
git stash save "emergency-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create new recovery branch
git checkout -b recovery/attempt-2

# Start over with single issue
# Pick ONE error from build output
# Fix only that error
# Commit when working
```

### If Overwhelmed by Scope
1. **STOP** all work immediately
2. **BREATHE** - Take 15-minute break
3. **FOCUS** - Pick ONE error from build output
4. **FIX** - Address only that specific error
5. **TEST** - Verify fix works
6. **COMMIT** - Save progress
7. **REPEAT** - Move to next single error
