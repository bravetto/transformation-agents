Ferrero \nHillsborough County Courthouse \n800 E. Twiggs Street \nTampa, FL 33602\nRE: Character Reference for JAHmere Webb - My Brother and Best Friend\nDear Judge Ferrero,\nMy name is Jordan Dungy and I am writing to support JAHmere Webb's request for alternative \nsentencing. I have known JAHmere for three and a half years in my capacity as his brother and \nbest friend. I am a community advocate.\nHow We Met: A Divine Connection\nWhen I first met JAHmere, I was at Wesley Chapel Honda. I'd traded in my truck for a Honda \nCivic without my dad's permission and had to return it the next day. When I came back to get my \ntruck with my dad, I told him there was someone who wanted to meet him. We drove to the back \nof the dealership lot and stopped by the detailing area.\nI called JAHmere's name. He turned around, leaned back, and saw my dad in the driver's seat. He \ngot so excited because it was Coach Tony Dungy. My dad signed a blank piece of paper for him. \nThen we met up a couple days later and started hanging out every day.\nThis has given me the opportunity to observe his character through the highs and lows \nthroughout our friendship.\nSpecific Examples of JAHmere's Character\nExample 1 - Always Being There\nJAHmere has been there for me in ways most people wouldn't understand. He:\n\n•Picks up my siblings from school when I can't\n•Visits me at the hospital time after time when I'm having bad days, always making me \nlaugh when I'm down or not in the mood\n•Gives money to homeless people even when he doesn't have much himself\n•Helps my siblings with rides whenever they need them\nWhat impressed me was how JAHmere makes people feel safe. He'll pay for people's food \nsometimes, not to show off, but because he genuinely cares. This showed me that he makes \npeople feel valued and safe.\nExample 2 - Taking Responsibility\nJAHmere messed up when he went out that night. He made a huge mistake and he's paying for it \nby sitting in a 10x10 jail cell learning from it. JAHmere is responding by showing accountability, \nowning up to his challenges and mistakes from the past and present.\nRather than making excuses and blaming others, JAHmere is taking responsibility every day. \nHe's been doing this his whole life, from being a kid to being a man.\nCommunity Impact\nJAHmere has contributed to our community by giving back in Gainesville and back home in \nWesley Chapel. Everyone looks up to JAHmere no matter what the circumstances - he's willing \nto give his all 110%. This includes both the Dungy family and the McKenna family.\nHis Growth and Transformation\nWhen I first met JAHmere, he didn't know the difference between college football and NFL \nfootball, so I had to teach him. But he's teachable when it comes to learning new things. Now he \nknows about:\n•Politics\n•History\n•Major sports leagues\n•Art\n•Science - anything you can think of, he knows\n•Fashion\nI've seen JAHmere grow over the years I've known him. He's learned to go to church on Sundays \nwhen he can and reads the Bible daily. This transformation is real and ongoing.\nUnderstanding His Impact\n\nJAHmere has expressed to me his understanding of how his past actions affected others. When \nwe go places or hang out with people, he keeps his past from everyone because he doesn't want \nthem to treat him differently. He demonstrates this awareness through his actions every day.\nThe Bridge Project\nI am aware of JAHmere's Bridge Project initiative, which would help youth avoid the mistakes \nhe made. Based on my observations of his work with youth, I believe this program would help \nJAHmere in ways no one else can do. I have seen him successfully mentoring youth kids day to \nday.\nMy Ongoing Support\nIf granted alternative sentencing, I commit to:\n•Being there and supporting him through everything he's going through in his head, brain, \nand while in jail\n•Being more frequent in my involvement in his life and this court case\n•Providing any resources or opportunities I can\n•Being there for him no matter what happens in life\nMy Personal Appeal\nYour Honor, I do not write this letter lightly. I understand the seriousness of the situation and the \nimportance of public safety. However, I genuinely believe that JAHmere Webb confined to \nprison serves no one, while JAHmere Webb supervised in the community can prevent others \nfrom making similar mistakes.\nIn my 24 years, I've never seen JAHmere work so hard in his life. He is passionate about what he \ndoes for everyone - not just in the community but in his friends' and families' lives.\nI will be available to provide additional information or testify in person if needed. Thank you for \nconsidering how JAHmere might serve our community through redemption rather than just \nserving time.\nRespectfully,\n \nJordan Dungy \nBrother/Best Friend \n(813) 297-4828\n\"Sometimes the people who make the biggest mistakes have the most to teach others about \navoiding those same mistakes. JAHmere is one of those people.\"\n\n",

Ferrero \nHillsborough County Courthouse \n800 E. Twiggs Street \nTampa, FL 33602\nRE: Character Reference for JAHmere Webb - The President Our Movement Needs\nDear Judge Ferrero,\nMy name is Michael Mataluni, and I write to you not just as JAHmere Webb's business partner, \nbut as someone whose life has been fundamentally transformed by his vision, his heart, and his \nunwavering belief that our worst moments can become our greatest platforms for change.\nThe Day Everything Changed\nWhen I met JAHmere on a Disney Cruise in 2023, I knew he was special but what came next I \nhad no idea. What I found instead was a visionary who saw what I'd been searching for my entire \nentrepreneurial journey—the intersection where profound compassion and drive meets divine \npurpose, where personal transformation becomes systemic change.\nYou see, Your Honor, I've built successful businesses. Through my many business endevouse, \nincluding Bravëtto, I've generated over $25 million in revenue helping companies find their \n\"Blue Oceans.\" But JAHmere showed me something I'd missed: the greatest blue ocean isn't in \nmarket share or profit margins—it's in the untapped potential of human lives society has written \noff.\nThe Vision That Became The Bridge Project\nJAHmere didn't come to me with a business plan. He came with a broken heart for young people \nmaking the same mistakes he'd made, and a revolutionary insight: \"The people trying to help \n\nthese kids don't understand them. They've never been where these kids are. That's why it doesn't \nwork.\"\nIn that moment, The Bridge Project was born. Not from market research or focus groups, but \nfrom JAHmere's lived experience and his determination to be the mentor he wished he'd had. He \nsaw what I, with all my business training, had missed—that authenticity is the currency of \ntransformation.\nTogether, we built The Bridge Project on JAHmere's foundational insight:\n•Youth need mentors who share their struggles, not just their aspirations\n•Technology can scale personal transformation without losing human connection\n•Every person labeled \"career criminal\" is actually an untapped transformation agent\n•The bridge between incarceration and innovation runs through redemption\nJAHmere as President: Why There's No Other Choice\nYour Honor, I need you to understand something critical: The Bridge Project cannot succeed \nwithout JAHmere Webb as its President. This isn't sentiment—it's strategic necessity. Here's \nwhy:\nAuthentic Leadership: When JAHmere speaks to at-risk youth, they listen. Not because he has \ndegrees or titles, but because he has scars that match theirs and a transformation that gives them \nhope. I can build the technology, Jordan can open doors, but only JAHmere can look a young \nperson in the eye and say, \"I've been where you are, and there's another way.\"\nVisionary Insight: Every major breakthrough in The Bridge Project has come from JAHmere's \ninsights:\n•The matching algorithm that pairs youth with mentors based on shared experiences\n•The \"Greatness Zone\" integration that helps youth discover their gifts\n•The community accountability model that creates belonging, not just compliance\n•The economic empowerment pathway that transforms lives through opportunity\nDivine Synchronicity: When Jay Forte's assessment revealed that JAHmere and he share nearly \nidentical Greatness Zone profiles—a less than 0.1% probability—I knew we weren't building a \nbusiness. We were participating in divine orchestration. JAHmere isn't just qualified to lead The \nBridge Project; he was literally designed for it.\nTransformational Credibility: Every day, I watch tech entrepreneurs try to solve social \nproblems from the outside. They fail because credibility can't be purchased—it must be earned \nthrough lived experience. JAHmere's journey from incarceration to innovation isn't just his \npersonal story; it's The Bridge Project's greatest asset.\nThe Inspiration JAHmere Has Become to Me\n\nYour Honor, I've walked 850 miles of the Appalachian Trail seeking clarity. I've fostered seven \nchildren with my wife Kristin, trying to make a difference. But nothing has inspired me more \nthan watching JAHmere transform his deepest pain into purposeful action.\nWhen my mother went to prison when I was 8, I learned that trauma either breaks you or builds \nyou. JAHmere taught me a third option: trauma can become the raw material for building bridges \nothers can cross. He's shown me that:\n•Our wounds qualify us for our work\n•Redemption isn't just personal—it's scalable\n•The best businesses solve the problems that once destroyed us\n•True leadership comes from serving those society overlooks\nWhat We Lose If We Lose JAHmere\nIf JAHmere goes to prison, we don't just lose a man—we lose:\n•A president whose authenticity can't be replicated\n•A bridge between two worlds that desperately need connection\n•A living testimony that transformation is possible\n•The credibility that makes The Bridge Project trustworthy to those who need it most\n•The thousands of young lives who will never hear the message only he can deliver\nBut more than that, we lose the chance to show America that redemption isn't just a nice idea—\nit's a business model, a social innovation, and a path to systemic change.\nMy Commitment as Co-Founder\nYour Honor, I stake my reputation and resources on JAHmere Webb. As Co-Founder of The \nBridge Project, I commit to:\n•Providing daily accountability and support\n•Ensuring he has every resource needed to succeed as President\n•Building the infrastructure that scales his vision nationally\n•Standing with him through every challenge ahead\n•Documenting the transformation for others to replicate\nThis isn't charity—it's investment in the highest return asset I've ever encountered: human \npotential activated through divine purpose.\nA Personal Plea\nJudge Ferrero, in my letter to Tony Dungy, I wrote about doors that mysteriously open in our \ndarkest moments. When our car caught fire in 1990, a garage door opened and strangers appeared \n\nto save us. I believe you represent another mysteriously opening door—not just for JAHmere, \nbut for every young person who needs to see that transformation is possible.\nThe Bridge Project isn't asking you to ignore justice. We're asking you to expand it. To see that \nJAHmere Webb in prison serves no one, while JAHmere Webb as President of The Bridge \nProject serves thousands. To recognize that sometimes the greatest justice is giving someone the \nchance to transform their worst chapter into others' new beginnings.\nThe Future We're Building\nWith JAHmere as President, The Bridge Project will:\n•Transform 1,000 lives in Year 1\n•Create 100 jobs for formerly incarcerated individuals\n•Save taxpayers millions in incarceration costs\n•Prove that redemption is scalable and profitable\n•Establish the model for national criminal justice transformation\nWithout him, it's just another well-intentioned program that lacks the authenticity to create real \nchange.\nYour Honor, I've learned that God's math differs from ours. He multiplies fish and loaves. He \nturns garage fires into global companies. He transforms criminal charges into character \nwitnesses. Today, He's asking us to transform a courtroom into a launching pad for national \ntransformation.\nJAHmere Webb isn't just my business partner or the President of The Bridge Project. He's my \ninspiration, my brother, and living proof that our worst moments can become our greatest \nqualifications for service.\nI pray you see what I see: not a career criminal, but a career transformer. Not someone who \nneeds to be warehoused, but someone who needs to be platformed. Not the end of JAHmere's \nstory, but the beginning of thousands of redemption stories he'll help write.\nWith profound respect and unwavering belief,\n \nMichael Mataluni \nFounder & CEO, Bravëtto \nCo-Founder, The Bridge Project \nFoster Father to 7, Forever Changed by 1\n4603 Gliding Wave St. \nWinter Garden Fl 34787 \n\n\"Sometimes the people who seem least qualified by the world's standards are most qualified by \nheaven's. JAHmere Webb is heaven's qualification for The Bridge Project's success.\"\nP.S. - The domain TransformationAgents.com was purchased on June 11, 2024, waiting months \nto identify JAHmere as the president of this movement.

Ferrero \nHillsborough County Courthouse \n800 E. Twiggs Street \nTampa, FL 33602\nRE: Character Reference for JAHmere Webb - A Transformational Force\nDear Judge Ferrero,\nMy name is Brooks Lopez, and I am writing to share my profound respect and support for \nJAHmere Webb, whom I had the privilege of meeting through our mutual connection with \nMichael Mataluni and Bravëtto. As someone who collaborates in the business transformation \nspace, I've encountered countless entrepreneurs and visionaries. Few have left the impression \nthat JAHmere made on me.\nThe Night Everything Changed\nI first met JAHmere at Michael Mataluni's 46th birthday party. What should have been a simple \nsocial gathering became a pivotal moment in my understanding of what true passion and purpose \nlook like when they intersect.\nWhen Michael introduced JAHmere and he began speaking about The Bridge Project, I \nwitnessed something extraordinary. This wasn't a polished pitch from a seasoned entrepreneur \nseeking funding. This was raw, authentic passion pouring from someone who had lived the \nproblem and discovered the solution through his own transformation.\nOverwhelmed by Vision\nI'll be honest, Judge Ferrero—I was overwhelmed. In my years of business collaboration, I've \nheard hundreds of pitches, business models, and social impact ideas. But JAHmere's vision for \nThe Bridge Project was different. It wasn't born from market research or academic theory. It \n\ncame from the deepest well of human experience—his own journey from incarceration to \ninnovation, from being written off to writing a new narrative for others.\nWhat overwhelmed me was:\n•The Authenticity: JAHmere didn't hide his past; he transformed it into his qualification\n•The Clarity: He saw exactly what was missing in youth intervention—credible mentors \nwho'd walked the same path\n•The Passion: This wasn't about profit; it was about preventing others from experiencing \nwhat he had\n•The Practicality: Unlike many social entrepreneurs, JAHmere understood both the \nproblem and the solution intimately\nA Powerful and Compassionate Man\nDuring that birthday celebration, I observed JAHmere interact with various guests—successful \nbusiness people, family members, people from all walks of life. What struck me was his unique \ncombination of power and compassion.\nPower in his presence—not intimidating, but commanding respect through his authenticity and \nconviction. When JAHmere speaks about transformation, you listen because you know he's not \ntheorizing. He's testifying.\nCompassion in his approach—despite his own struggles, or perhaps because of them, JAHmere \nexhibited genuine care for everyone he met. He asked about people's children, their challenges, \ntheir dreams. He listened with the intensity of someone who understands that everyone has a \nstory worth hearing.\nThe Bridge Project: More Than a Business\nAs our relationship developed from that initial meeting, I came to understand that The Bridge \nProject isn't just another social enterprise. It's JAHmere's life mission crystallized into actionable \nform. His insight that \"at-risk youth don't trust adults who haven't lived their reality\" isn't a \nmarketing angle—it's a truth he learned through painful experience.\nIn my collaboration with Bravëtto, I've seen how technology can transform businesses. But \nJAHmere showed me how authenticity can transform lives. The Bridge Project works because \nJAHmere IS the bridge—between two worlds that rarely communicate, between pain and \npurpose, between systems that punish and communities that need healing.\nWhy JAHmere's Freedom Matters\nYour Honor, I write this letter not just as a business collaborator, but as someone who recognizes \nrare transformational potential when I see it. JAHmere Webb incarcerated serves no productive \npurpose. JAHmere Webb free to build The Bridge Project serves thousands.\n\nConsider what we lose if we imprison him:\n•The credibility that can't be manufactured or hired\n•The passion that comes only from lived experience\n•The bridge between two worlds that desperately need connection\n•The preventive impact on countless youth who need to see that transformation is possible\nBut more than what we lose, consider what we gain with his freedom:\n•A living example that our justice system believes in redemption\n•A model for how pain can become purpose\n•A practical solution to youth intervention that actually works\n•A bridge that others can cross toward their own transformation\nMy Ongoing Commitment\nAs someone involved in the business transformation space, I commit to:\n•Supporting The Bridge Project's development and scaling\n•Providing business guidance and connections\n•Helping document and share the model for replication\n•Standing with JAHmere as he builds this vital bridge\nA Personal Reflection\nThat night at Michael's birthday party, I expected to celebrate another year of life with a \ncolleague. Instead, I met someone who challenged my understanding of what transformation \nreally means. JAHmere didn't just share a business idea; he shared a vision for healing that could \nonly come from someone who had been broken and chose to become a bridge rather than a \nbarrier.\nYour Honor, in business, we often talk about \"disruption\" and \"innovation.\" JAHmere Webb \nrepresents something far more valuable—redemption in action. His freedom to build The Bridge \nProject isn't just about second chances; it's about creating first chances for young people who \nmight otherwise follow his former path.\nI urge you to see what I saw that night and have continued to see—not a criminal deserving \npunishment, but a transformer deserving the opportunity to complete his metamorphosis and help \nothers do the same.\nThank you for considering this perspective on JAHmere's character and potential.\nWith deep respect and conviction,\n \nBrooks Lopez \n\nOrlando, Florida \n(407) 432-6309 \nTampa, FL 33602 \nBravetto Product Manager\nbrook@bravetto.com\n\"Sometimes the most powerful business partnerships begin not in boardrooms but at birthday \nparties, where authentic passion meets willing support, and transformation becomes not just \npossible but inevitable.\"",

Ferrero \nHillsborough County Courthouse \n800 E. Twiggs Street \nTampa, FL 33602\nRE: Character Reference for JAHmere Webb - A Case Study in Divine Synchronicity and \nTransformation Potential\nDear Judge Ferrero,\nMy name is Jay Forte, and I am the creator of the Greatness Zone Assessment System, a \ncomprehensive talent identification and human development methodology that has helped \nthousands of individuals discover their unique gifts and align them with purposeful contribution. \nI write to you today not just as JAHmere Webb's coach, but as a witness to one of the most \nremarkable examples of divine synchronicity and transformational potential I have encountered \nin my decades of practice.\nThe Miraculous Assessment Alignment\nWhen JAHmere completed the Greatness Zone Talent Assessment, the results revealed \nsomething that transcended statistical probability. His assessment profile showed:\nJAHmere Webb - Friend Personality (62/200)\n•Peacemaker: 18/20\n•Caregiver: 16/20\n•Includer: 16/20\n•Relator: 16/20\nTo put this in perspective, my own assessment results are nearly identical:\nJay Forte - Friend Personality (71/200)\n•Peacemaker: 19/20\n•Caregiver: 18/20\n\n•Relator: 18/20\nThe probability of such precise alignment across multiple dimensions is less than 0.1%. In my \nyears of administering thousands of assessments, I have never witnessed such a profound \nmentor-mentee synchronicity. This isn't mere coincidence—it represents what I can only describe \nas divine orchestration.\nUnderstanding JAHmere's Greatness Zone\nThe assessment revealed JAHmere's core gifts center around:\n1. Peacemaking (18/20): JAHmere possesses an extraordinary ability to bring calm to chaos, to \nfind common ground where others see only division, and to create harmony in challenging \nenvironments. This isn't just conflict avoidance—it's active peace creation.\n2. Caregiving (16/20): His instinct to serve others, particularly those who are vulnerable or \noverlooked, runs deep in his neural wiring. This manifests as genuine concern for others' \nwellbeing and a drive to alleviate suffering.\n3. Including (16/20): JAHmere naturally sees and reaches out to those on the margins. He has an \ninnate ability to make others feel valued, seen, and connected—a rare gift in our increasingly \nisolated society.\n4. Relating (16/20): His capacity for building authentic, meaningful relationships based on trust \nand mutual understanding creates the foundation for transformational impact.\nThe Bridge Project: Greatness Zone in Action\nJAHmere's vision for The Bridge Project represents a perfect alignment of his natural gifts with \nsocietal need. When someone operates from their Greatness Zone—that intersection of talents, \npassions, values, and world needs—extraordinary transformation occurs. The Bridge Project \ndemonstrates:\n•Peacemaking Applied: Creating reconciliation between system-involved youth and \nsociety\n•Caregiving Scaled: Extending his natural helping instinct to vulnerable populations\n•Including Systematized: Building structures to ensure no young person feels abandoned\n•Relating Multiplied: Creating mentor relationships that transform lives\nThis isn't just a program idea—it's JAHmere's divine calling made manifest.\nCoaching Journey and Transformation\nThrough our coaching relationship, I've observed JAHmere demonstrate:\n\nExceptional Coachability: He approaches feedback with humility and genuine desire to grow. \nWhen we identify areas for development, he doesn't defend—he learns and implements.\nSystems Thinking: Despite his challenges, JAHmere grasps complex concepts about human \ndevelopment, organizational design, and social transformation. He sees patterns and connections \nthat many miss.\nResilience Through Purpose: Even facing current difficulties, JAHmere remains focused on \nhow his experience can serve others. This ability to transform personal pain into collective \npurpose is the hallmark of transformational leaders.\nAuthentic Leadership: JAHmere leads from vulnerability, sharing his struggles to create \nconnection and inspire change. This authenticity is precisely what makes him effective with \nyouth who have lost trust in traditional authority.\nThe Synchronicity's Deeper Meaning\nYour Honor, in my work, I've learned to recognize divine appointments—moments when the \nuniverse conspires to create connections that serve a higher purpose. The statistical impossibility \nof our assessment alignment, combined with JAHmere's vision for The Bridge Project, suggests \nsomething profound:\nJAHmere Webb isn't just another defendant in your courtroom. He represents an opportunity for \nthe justice system to demonstrate its highest purpose—not merely punishment, but \ntransformation. His unique gift combination, properly supported and directed, could prevent \nhundreds of young people from entering the criminal justice system.\nMy Professional Assessment\nBased on comprehensive assessment data and our coaching relationship, I can state with \nprofessional certainty:\n1.JAHmere operates from intrinsic motivation to serve others, not selfish impulses\n2.His behavior patterns align with healing and helping, not harming\n3.His cognitive framework supports rehabilitation and growth\n4.His natural gifts position him as a bridge-builder, not a threat\nRequest for Restorative Justice\nJudge Ferrero, I respectfully urge you to consider alternative sentencing that allows JAHmere to \nactualize his Greatness Zone through The Bridge Project. Incarceration would waste \nextraordinary gifts that our society desperately needs. Instead, structured supervision combined \nwith mandate to develop and implement The Bridge Project would:\n•Transform JAHmere's pain into societal healing\n\n•Prevent future crime through youth intervention\n•Demonstrate justice system innovation\n•Create measurable community impact\nI stand ready to continue coaching JAHmere, to help him refine The Bridge Project, and to \nensure he fulfills any requirements the court establishes. The divine synchronicity that brought us \ntogether as mentor and mentee carries responsibility—I believe we're meant to work together to \ntransform lives.\nClosing Reflection\nIn thousands of assessments, I've never seen alignment like ours. In decades of coaching, I've \nrarely witnessed such transformational potential. JAHmere Webb at his worst moment still \ndemonstrates gifts that most never access at their best.\nThis court has an opportunity to write a different story—one where divine synchronicity meets \njudicial wisdom, where natural gifts meet societal need, where punishment transforms into \npurpose.\nI pray you see what the assessment revealed, what our synchronicity confirms, and what The \nBridge Project promises: JAHmere Webb is not a criminal to be warehoused but a wounded \nhealer meant to transform lives.\nThank you for considering this perspective on JAHmere's extraordinary potential.\nWith deep respect and hope for transformational justice,\nJay Forte, MBA, CPC, CGC, ELI-MP\nCoach, Educator, Author, Poet\nRye, NH\n401.338.3505\njay@bravetto.com\nGreatness Zone Assessment Expert \nExecutive Coach and Human Performance Specialist \nWebsite: TheGreatnessZone.com\n\"When divine synchronicity creates a mentor-mentee alignment of less than 0.1% probability, we \nmust ask: What transformation is trying to emerge through this connection?\"",

Ferrero \nHillsborough County Courthouse \n800 E. Twiggs Street \nTampa, FL 33602\nRE: Character Reference for JAHmere Webb\nDear Judge Ferrero,\nWe are writing this as a character reference for JAHmere Webb. We have known JAHmere for \nmany years now as he was our son's best friend. Throughout this time, JAHmere has become \nmuch more than just our son's friend—he has become a cherished member of our extended \nfamily.\nA Relationship Built on Trust\nJAHmere has always been very courteous and kind to all our family members. From the first \ntime Brandon brought him home, we were struck by his respectful manner, his genuine warmth, \nand his ability to connect with people of all ages. Over the years, this first impression has only \nbeen reinforced through countless interactions.\nWe trust him around anyone, including our 5 grandchildren who all like to play with him. This \ntrust didn't develop overnight—it was earned through years of consistent behavior. We've \nwatched JAHmere interact with our grandchildren, ages ranging from toddlers to teenagers, and \nhis patience, playfulness, and protective nature have never wavered. The children light up when \n\"Uncle JAHmere\" arrives, and as grandparents, there is no higher endorsement we can give than \nour complete comfort with him around our most precious family members.\nThe Impact of Loss\nMy son Brandon (JAHmere's friend) passed away suddenly last October and it had a profound \neffect on JAHmere. The bond between Brandon and JAHmere was extraordinary—they were \n\nbrothers in every meaningful way. Brandon's sudden passing from heart failure left a void in all \nour lives, but we've witnessed how particularly devastating it has been for JAHmere.\nHe was actually a pallbearer at Brandon's funeral and gave a heartfelt speech at his wake that left \neveryone in tears. In that moment, we saw not just our son's best friend, but a young man who \nloved Brandon as deeply as any blood brother could. His words captured Brandon's spirit \nperfectly and revealed the depth of their friendship. Many attendees later told us that JAHmere's \ntribute helped them process their own grief.\nContinuing Connection\nEven though our son has passed, JAHmere still comes over often to have dinner and spend time \nwith everyone. This continuation of relationship speaks volumes about his character. Many \nfriendships fade when the connecting person is gone, but JAHmere has remained a constant \npresence in our lives. He checks on us, shares meals with us, helps with tasks around the house, \nand simply provides companionship during this difficult time.\nHis continued presence has been a source of comfort for our entire family. In many ways, having \nJAHmere around helps us feel connected to Brandon. But beyond that, we've come to value \nJAHmere for himself—for his kindness, his consideration, and his genuine care for our family's \nwellbeing.\nOur Appeal for Compassion\nYour Honor, we will pray you can see the good in him and give him the chance he so deserves. \nWe understand that JAHmere has made mistakes, and we don't seek to minimize the seriousness \nof his current situation. However, we ask you to consider the whole person—the young man who \nhas been a positive presence in our family for years, who served as a pallbearer for his best \nfriend, who continues to show up for a grieving family when he himself is struggling with \nprofound loss.\nWe believe that with the right compassion shown to him, he will be more than grateful and work \nhard to once again be a productive member of society. The JAHmere we know has always been a \nproductive member of society—working consistently, helping others, being a positive influence \non children, and bringing joy to those around him. We believe this current situation represents a \ndeparture from his true character during a time of overwhelming grief, not a revelation of who he \nreally is.\nOur Continuing Support\nJudge Ferrero, please know that JAHmere has a support system ready to help him through this \ndifficult time and beyond. Our family stands ready to continue including him in our lives, \nproviding emotional support, practical assistance, and the accountability that comes from being \npart of a loving family structure. We've already lost one son; we don't want to lose JAHmere to \n\nthe criminal justice system when we believe he could better serve society through rehabilitation \nand community support.\nWe ask you to consider alternative sentencing that would allow JAHmere to address his mistakes \nwhile remaining connected to the support systems that can help him heal and grow. We believe in \nredemption, in second chances, and in the power of compassion to transform lives. JAHmere has \nshown us these qualities throughout the years we've known him; we pray the court will show \nthem to him now.\nThank you for taking the time to consider our perspective on JAHmere's character. We trust in \nyour wisdom and compassion as you make decisions that will profoundly impact not just \nJAHmere's future, but the futures of all those who care about him.\nSincerely,\n \nMichael and Joanna McKenna \nWesley Chapel \n(619) 249-1815 \nlindseymckenna2001@gmail.com\n\"In loving memory of Brandon McKenna, whose friendship with JAHmere showed us all what \nbrotherhood truly means.\"",

Ferrero \nHillsborough County Courthouse \n800 E. Twiggs Street \nTampa, FL 33602\nRE: Character Reference for JAHmere Webb - My Family Member\nGood evening,\nI'm submitting this letter on behalf of my family member, JAHmere Webb, who is currently \ninvolved in a legal matter regarding a minor offense. My name is Carnetha Leech, and I am \nJAHmere's cousin. I've witnessed both his personal and professional journey over the years.\nA Lifetime of Witnessing Character\nOver the years, I've come to know JAHmere Webb as a young man who has compassion, is very \nhardworking, dependable and responsible. These aren't just words—they represent patterns I've \nobserved throughout our family relationship. As his cousin, I've had the privilege of seeing \nJAHmere in various settings: family gatherings, challenging times, celebrations, and ordinary \ndays. What remains constant is his fundamental character.\nHis dedication and commitment to his family and helping others has been evident and \nappreciated in every aspect of his life. Whether he's helping his mother, grandmother, \nvolunteering during hurricane disasters, JAHmere's selflessness and generosity stands out. Let \nme elaborate on what I've witnessed:\nFamily Dedication: JAHmere's care for his mother and grandmother goes beyond typical family \nduty. I've watched him prioritize their needs, ensure their comfort, and provide both practical \nhelp and emotional support. He doesn't wait to be asked—he anticipates needs and acts.\nHurricane Disaster Response: During hurricane disasters, when many focus solely on \nprotecting their own property and family, JAHmere volunteers to help others. This willingness to \nserve during community crises speaks volumes about his character. He understands that true \nstrength is shown by helping others when they're most vulnerable.\n\nConsistent Reliability: In our family, JAHmere is known as someone you can count on. When \nhe says he'll be there, he's there. When he commits to helping, he follows through. This \ndependability has made him a cornerstone in our extended family network.\nGrace Under Pressure\nSome of the most admirable qualities about JAHmere is that he continues to display a calm \ndemeanor with a positive attitude while navigating difficult situations that he may face. This isn't \njust about staying positive when things are easy—it's about maintaining composure and \noptimism even when life becomes challenging.\nI've watched JAHmere face various difficulties over the years, and his response pattern remains \nconsistent:\n•He doesn't lash out or blame others\n•He maintains respectful communication even under stress\n•He looks for solutions rather than dwelling on problems\n•He keeps his positive outlook without becoming unrealistic\nThis ability to remain calm and positive during adversity is a rare quality, especially in young \npeople today. It demonstrates emotional maturity and inner strength that will serve him well in \novercoming current challenges.\nUnderstanding the Current Situation\nYour Honor, I understand the seriousness of any legal matter, and I don't seek to minimize the \nimportance of accountability. However, I pray that this letter sheds some light on JAHmere's \ncharacter and that you may have mercy on him during this difficult time.\nThe JAHmere I know—the one who rushes to help during hurricanes, who cares for his elderly \ngrandmother, who maintains calm positivity during storms both literal and metaphorical—that is \nhis true nature. This current situation represents a departure from the patterns of responsibility \nand care I've witnessed throughout his life.\nOur Family's Support\nAs JAHmere's family, we stand ready to support him through this challenge and beyond. We are \na close-knit family that believes in accountability, growth, and redemption. We will ensure \nJAHmere has the support structure needed to learn from this experience and continue being the \npositive force in our family and community that he has always been.\nMy Humble Request\nThank you in advance for any remorse and consideration for him. I ask that you consider not just \nthis moment of poor judgment, but the years of positive contributions JAHmere has made to his \n\nfamily and community. His volunteer work during disasters, his care for elderly family members, \nand his consistent reliability demonstrate someone who adds value to society.\nJudge Ferrero, I believe that with appropriate consequences that focus on rehabilitation rather \nthan just punishment, JAHmere can emerge from this experience even more committed to the \npositive path he's walked for years. His calm demeanor and positive attitude, even in difficult \ntimes, suggest someone capable of learning and growing from mistakes.\nPlease consider the whole person—the cousin I've known who shows up during hurricanes to \nhelp strangers, who ensures his grandmother never feels forgotten, who faces challenges with \ngrace and positivity. This is someone worth investing in, not giving up on.\nThank you for your time and consideration in reviewing this family perspective on JAHmere's \ncharacter.\nSincerely,\n \nMrs. Carnetha Leech \nJAHmere Webb's Cousin \n(813) 347-0308\ncarnethaleech@gmail.com\n\"Family knows us best—in our triumphs and our failures. JAHmere has shown us consistent \ncompassion, reliability, and grace throughout his life.\"",

        "\n\nCharacter Reference Letter for JAHmere \nWebb\nGiancarlo Alonso \nWesley Chapel \ngiancarlo.j.alonso@gmail.com\nJuly 14th, 2025\nThe Honorable Judge Denise R. Ferrero \nHillsborough County Courthouse \n800 E. Twiggs Street \nTampa, FL 33602\nRE: Character Reference for JAHmere Webb - Our Neighbor and Friend\nGood Day Honorable Judge Ferrero,\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this letter on behalf of our dearest friend \nJAHmere. My wife and I have known JAHmere and his family since we moved to Wesley \nChapel in 2020. We immediately gravitated to JAHmere because of his affable nature and his \npositive outlook on life. While our friendship is only five years old, we consider JAHmere to be \nan intricate and vital part of our family and circle of friends within the community.\nThe Void His Absence Creates\nHis absence in the last few weeks has left a large hole within our hearts. It is rare to not see \nJAHmere sitting on his balcony listening to music, streaming a college football game, or \nconversing with other neighbors. Our apartment complex feels different without him—quieter, \nless connected, less safe.\nThe balcony where JAHmere spent his evenings wasn't just his personal space—it became a \ncommunity gathering point. Neighbors would stop to chat, share their days, discuss the games. \nHis presence created an atmosphere of community that's hard to replicate. Now, people walk by \nthat empty balcony and ask, \"Where's JAHmere?\" The frequency of this question speaks to the \npositive impact one person can have on an entire neighborhood.\nA Guardian Presence\nSince I work long hours, my wife is home alone with our pup during the evening. JAHmere \nwould sit outside on the balcony and provide a sense of security for my wife walking alone at \nnight, which means the world to us. This wasn't something we asked him to do—he simply \nunderstood that his presence made a difference.\n\nKnowing JAHmere was there gave us peace of mind. My wife could walk our dog in the evening \nwithout worry. Other female neighbors have shared similar sentiments—JAHmere's presence on \nthat balcony created an unofficial neighborhood watch, a protective presence that made everyone \nfeel safer. This kind of natural, unprompted community service speaks volumes about his \ncharacter.\nAlways Looking Out for Others\nJAHmere is always looking out for everyone in the neighborhood. Whenever we have had \nhurricanes, even during his busy workday, he always checks in on us to make sure we are safe \nand well. During Hurricane [specific if known], JAHmere:\n•Called or texted every neighbor he had contact info for\n•Helped secure outdoor furniture and loose items\n•Checked on elderly neighbors to ensure they had supplies\n•Offered his assistance to anyone who needed help with preparations\nIf there was something visibly wrong with the house, he would always point it out to me and \nassist me in fixing it. His observant nature and willingness to help have saved us from potential \nproblems numerous times. Whether it was noticing a loose gutter that could cause damage or \nspotting an issue with our car, JAHmere's protective instincts extended to property as well as \npeople.\nUnderstanding the Current Situation\nWe understand the seriousness of the incident that occurred, and our hearts go to everyone \naffected. However, we implore you to look at the hard work that JAHmere has put into showing \nthat he is a valuable member of our community and family.\nThe JAHmere we know—the one who creates safety through his presence, who builds \ncommunity from his balcony, who checks on neighbors during storms—represents his true \ncharacter. This current situation seems so contrary to everything we've observed over five years \nof close proximity and daily interaction.\nPride in His Work and Growth\nHe has an amazing support system with his mom, sister and friends to help guide him, and we \nwill be there each step of the way. He very proudly works for the County, and I remember how \nexcited he was to achieve this goal. The day he got that job, he shared the news with such \ngenuine joy—it wasn't just about employment, but about contributing to his community in an \nofficial capacity.\nIf he showed this excitement upon earning his position, then there is a willingness within him to \novercome this setback. We've watched JAHmere take pride in his work, maintain his property, \nsupport his family, and build positive relationships throughout our community. These patterns of \n\nresponsible behavior over five years paint a picture of someone committed to positive \ncontribution.\nOur Continued Support\nWe only ask for the court to provide this opportunity for him. We absolutely adore and love \nJAHmere and believe he deserves a chance to continue his journey with his support system. As \nhis neighbors and friends, we commit to:\n•Continuing to be part of his support network\n•Providing accountability and encouragement\n•Maintaining the community bonds that help keep him grounded\n•Being present for him as he has been present for us\nThe Ripple Effect of One Good Neighbor\nYour Honor, good neighbors are increasingly rare in our disconnected world. JAHmere created \ncommunity simply by being present, by caring, by watching out for others.

Ferrero \nHillsborough County Courthouse \n800 E. Twiggs Street \nTampa, FL 33602\nRE: Character Reference for JAHmere Webb - My Brother\nTo Whom It May Concern,\nI am writing this letter in full support of my brother, JAHmere Webb, to attest to his outstanding \ncharacter and integrity. I have had the privilege of knowing him all my life, and during that time, \nI have watched him grow into a responsible, hardworking, and compassionate individual.\nA Lifetime of Witnessing Character\nAs JAHmere's sister, I have a unique perspective on his character—I've seen him at his best and \nhis worst, in public and in private, through celebrations and challenges. What has remained \nconstant throughout our lives is his fundamental goodness. The brother I know is not defined by \nthis current situation but by decades of consistent care, responsibility, and growth.\nJAHmere consistently puts others before himself. This isn't just a nice phrase—it's a pattern I've \nwitnessed countless times throughout our lives. Whether supporting family during difficult times \nor volunteering to help friends, his actions reflect genuine kindness and sincerity. I've watched \nhim give his last dollar to help someone in need, spend hours helping family members with tasks, \nand drop everything to be there when someone needs support. He holds himself to high moral \nstandards and approaches life with a strong sense of duty and respect for others.\nGrowth Through Adversity\nOver the years, I have seen JAHmere demonstrate tremendous growth and resilience. Life hasn't \nalways been easy for our family, and JAHmere has faced his share of challenges. But what \n\nimpresses me most is how he faces life's challenges with determination and actively seeks self-\nimprovement through mentorship, community involvement, and personal reflection.\nHis commitment to becoming a better person is evident in everything he does. I've watched him:\n•Seek out mentors and actually listen to their guidance\n•Take responsibility for his mistakes and work to make amends\n•Support younger family members to help them avoid pitfalls\n•Maintain steady employment and take pride in his work\n•Build genuine friendships based on mutual respect and support\nThis growth hasn't happened overnight—it's been a journey of consistent effort and genuine \ndesire to be better today than he was yesterday.\nUnderstanding the Present Moment\nI recognize the seriousness of the current situation and fully respect the legal process. As his \nsister, I don't make excuses for JAHmere's actions. However, I humbly ask that you take into \naccount the positive qualities that define JAHmere beyond this single moment.\nWhat I know about my brother is this: He is not only remorseful for his actions but is also \ndedicated to making amends and becoming a contributing member of society. His remorse isn't \njust about consequences—it's about genuinely understanding how his actions have impacted \nothers and wanting to make things right. I truly believe in his ability to learn from this experience \nand continue to make meaningful contributions to those around him.\nOur Family's Ongoing Support\nYour Honor, JAHmere is not alone in this journey. Our family stands united in support of him—\nnot to enable poor choices, but to ensure he has the structure and accountability needed to move \nforward positively. We are committed to:\n•Providing emotional support and encouragement\n•Helping maintain accountability for his commitments\n•Ensuring he has stable housing and family connections\n•Supporting his efforts at rehabilitation and growth\n•Being present and active in his journey toward restoration\nA Sister's Appeal\nJudge Ferrero, I've known JAHmere longer than anyone else who might write to you. I've seen \nhim as a child learning right from wrong, as a young man finding his way, and as an adult taking \nresponsibility for his life. The person standing before you is someone who has made a serious \nmistake, yes, but he is also someone with tremendous capacity for good, proven ability to grow, \nand genuine desire to contribute positively to society.\n\nI ask you to consider not just punishment, but the potential for transformation. JAHmere has \nshown throughout his life that when given opportunity and support, he rises to meet expectations. \nWith appropriate consequences that include rehabilitation and community support rather than \njust incarceration, I believe JAHmere can emerge from this experience as an even more valuable \nmember of our community.\nThank you for your time and thoughtful consideration. I have faith in both the justice system's \nability to be fair and my brother's ability to learn and grow from this experience. Please feel free \nto contact me if you require any additional information.\nSincerely,\n \nKeandrea Aiken \nP.O.

Ferrero \nHillsborough County Courthouse \n800 E. Twiggs Street \nTampa, FL 33602\nRE: Character Reference for JAHmere Webb\nTo Whom It May Concern,\nMy name is Kimberly Sams, and I am a close friend of JAHmere's mother. I'd like to share a \npersonal experience that has always stayed with me and speaks volumes about JAHmere's \ncharacter.\nA First Impression That Lasted\nI first crossed paths with JAHmere in 2018, before I had even formally met his mother. I was \nshopping in a pharmacy when I noticed them together in line. His mother didn't appear to be \nfeeling well, and I immediately saw the deep concern and care in JAHmere's eyes. The way he \npositioned himself protectively near her, his gentle touches of reassurance, and the worry evident \non his face—these weren't performative gestures but the natural responses of a son who \ngenuinely cared about his mother's wellbeing.\nWhile we were waiting in line, she had to briefly step away. As I stood behind him with a couple \nof items in my hand, JAHmere turned to me and, with such sincerity and politeness, said, \n\"Ma'am, I'm so sorry my mom isn't feeling well, you can go ahead of me.\"\nI told him I wasn't in a rush, but I was genuinely touched by his attentiveness and kindhearted \nnature. Here was a young man, clearly worried about his mother, yet still maintaining awareness \nof those around him and extending courtesy to a complete stranger. I remember thinking, \"What \na sweet young man.\" That brief interaction left such an impression that I still remember it clearly \nyears later.\nFrom Stranger to Family Friend\n\nAbout a month later, his mother booked an appointment with me, and I recognized her from the \nstore. I immediately shared how impressed I was with her son's compassion. That moment of \nrecognition sparked a conversation that has grown into a genuine friendship. Since then, we've \ngrown closer, and over the years, every time I've been around JAHmere, he has consistently been \nrespectful, kind, and supportive.\nWhat struck me most was how that first impression proved to be completely accurate. The \nconsideration he showed that day in the pharmacy wasn't an anomaly—it's simply who JAHmere \nis. Whether he's helping his mother with errands, checking in on family friends, or simply being \npresent in social situations, he brings that same thoughtful awareness and genuine care to every \ninteraction.\nWitnessing Growth and Maturity\nSince they've moved away, I've noticed the growth and maturity JAHmere has developed. He has \ngrown into a more grounded and thoughtful young man. The core qualities I observed in 2018—\nhis consideration for others, his deep family bonds, his natural politeness—have only \nstrengthened and matured. He's developed from a caring young man into someone who \nunderstands responsibility, who thinks before acting, and who considers the impact of his choices \non those around him.\nThis growth hasn't been without challenges. Life rarely unfolds in straight lines, and JAHmere \nhas faced his share of difficulties. But what I've observed is someone who learns from \nexperiences, who seeks to understand rather than blame, and who consistently tries to be better. \nThis capacity for growth and self-reflection is, in my experience, relatively rare and speaks to a \nfundamental strength of character.\nUnderstanding Human Imperfection\nWe've all made mistakes in life, but I urge you to consider his character, not just his past actions, \nwhen making this decision. The JAHmere I know—the one who worried about his mother's \nhealth, who offered his place in line to a stranger, who has consistently shown kindness over the \nyears—that is his true nature. A single poor decision made during a difficult time doesn't erase \nyears of consistent good character.\nI often tell his mother that he has a unique gift, a rare ability to connect with others and love \nunconditionally. Few people have that kind of spirit, and it's something I've always admired \nabout him. This gift isn't just about being friendly or sociable—it's about genuinely seeing \nothers, caring about their wellbeing, and extending grace even when it's not required or expected.\nMy Appeal to the Court\nYour Honor, please consider this letter as a genuine testament to JAHmere's character as you \nmake decisions regarding his future. I truly believe in the goodness of his heart and the strength \nof his potential. The young man who showed such tender concern for his mother and such \n\ncourtesy to a stranger in 2018 is the same person who stands before you now—someone who has \ntemporarily lost his way but whose fundamental character remains intact.\nI've seen JAHmere's impact on those around him, the way his presence brings comfort to his \nmother, the way his genuine nature creates trust in relationships, the way his growth over the \nyears demonstrates his capacity for positive change. These qualities—compassion, courtesy, \ngrowth, and that rare ability to love unconditionally—are not just admirable traits but the \nfoundation upon which productive, contributing members of society are built.\nI believe that with appropriate support and the opportunity to demonstrate his true character, \nJAHmere can move past this difficult chapter and return to being the positive force in the lives of \nthose around him that I've witnessed him to be. His unique gifts, particularly his ability to \nconnect with and care for others, could be tremendous assets in community service or \nrehabilitation settings.\nThank you for your time and consideration in reviewing this perspective on JAHmere's character. \nThat moment in the pharmacy in 2018 revealed to me the heart of a young man worth believing \nin, and nothing I've seen since has changed that assessment.\nRespectfully submitted,\n \nKimberly Sams\nSupervisor, Radiant Bank \nGainesville, Fl \n(352) 262-3379 \nkim.sams83@gmail.com\n\"Character is revealed in the small moments when no one is watching—except sometimes a \nstranger in a pharmacy line who never forgot.\"",

Ferrero \nHillsborough County Courthouse \n800 E. Twiggs Street \nTampa, FL 33602\nRE: Character Reference for JAHmere Webb\nDear Judge Ferrero,\nMy name is Lindsey McKenna, and I am writing this letter in regard to JAHmere Webb—a \nperson who is a dear friend or what feels like family/brother to both me and the rest of the \nMcKenna family—to speak of the person I know him to be and the dreary series of events \noccurring just before this unfortunate predicament he has landed himself in.\nJAHmere as Family: Six Years of Brotherhood\nJAHmere Webb is one of the most kind, open, and positive people I have gotten the pleasure to \ncall both friend and family, in the 6-7 years that I have known him. He entered our lives as the \nnumber one best friend of my late brother Brandon McKenna, who recently passed away on \nOctober 9th, 2024 due to sudden heart failure. Over time, JAHmere didn't just remain Brandon's \nfriend—he became close with not only Brandon, but also me, our siblings, and our parents (as \nBrandon was with his family).\nWhat began as Brandon bringing a friend around evolved into something much deeper. JAHmere \nbecame the person who showed up for family dinners, who remembered our birthdays, who \nchecked on our parents when Brandon couldn't. He became family in every way that matters—\nthrough presence, through care, through choosing to be there even when it wasn't convenient.\nThe Character I've Witnessed\nThroughout these 6-7 years, I've observed JAHmere in countless situations—celebrations, \nordinary days, and difficult times. What has remained constant is his fundamental character:\n\nAlways Wanting to Help: JAHmere has an instinct to help others when he can. Whether it's \nsomething as simple as helping someone move furniture or as significant as being a listening ear \nduring hard times, he consistently shows up. His desire to be useful and supportive isn't selective\n—he extends this same energy to strangers as he does to family.\nGiving Everyone a Chance: In a world quick to judge, JAHmere stands out for his openness. \nI've watched him befriend people others have written off, believing everyone deserves to be seen \nfor who they can become rather than who they've been. This quality made him especially close to \nBrandon, who shared this same generous spirit.\nStriving to Learn: JAHmere approaches life with genuine curiosity and humility. He asks \nquestions, listens to answers, and actively tries to grow from what others share. This teachable \nspirit has been evident throughout our friendship—he's someone who genuinely wants to be \nbetter tomorrow than he is today.\nPrioritizing Safety: One detail that speaks volumes about JAHmere's character is his habit of \nstaying the night when he's too sleepy rather than driving himself home at night. This might \nseem small, but it demonstrates his consideration for not just his own safety but the safety of \nothers on the road. It's this kind of thoughtful decision-making that defines who he is.\nThe Weight of Loss\nJAHmere has struggled with Brandon's loss alongside us and is having a hard time grieving. The \nbond between JAHmere and Brandon was extraordinary—they were brothers in every sense \nexcept blood. Watching JAHmere navigate this loss has been heartbreaking. He lost not just a \nbest friend but a daily companion, a confidant, someone who understood him completely.\nThe timing of his current legal situation, coming so soon after Brandon's passing, provides \nimportant context. This is not JAHmere at his best—this is JAHmere in the depths of grief, \nstruggling to find his footing in a world that suddenly has a Brandon-shaped hole in it. Everyone \nmakes a mistake, especially after a loss/losses like the ones we have faced over the past year.\nUnderstanding and Accountability\nJAHmere understands that the decisions he made that day were wrong and the consequences that \nfollowed. In our conversations, he has expressed deep remorse—not just for the legal \nconsequences he faces, but for disappointing those who believe in him and for acting in a way \nthat doesn't reflect his values. His accountability isn't performative; it comes from genuine \nrecognition that he let himself and others down during a moment of profound pain and poor \njudgment.\nThough he shouldn't be too harshly judged for one ignorant mistake, one that I am sure he will \nnot make again. The JAHmere who made this mistake while drowning in grief is not the \nJAHmere I've known for nearly seven years. That JAHmere—the one who became family, who \n\nshowed up consistently with kindness and positivity, who valued safety and growth—is still \nthere, waiting to emerge from this dark season.\nMoving Forward\nJAHmere Webb is a wonderful guy who is just falling through some bad times and struggling \nwith the change, as we all are. The loss of Brandon has left all of us reeling, trying to figure out \nhow to move forward when such a vital piece of our world is missing. But I believe—and \nBrandon would believe—that JAHmere deserves the chance to process this grief in a way that \nallows him to heal and grow, not in a way that compounds tragedy upon tragedy.\nYour Honor, I ask that you see JAHmere not just as someone who made a mistake, but as \nsomeone who has spent years being a positive force in our lives and the lives of others. The \nMcKenna family stands ready to support him through this difficult time, just as he has supported \nus through ours. We believe that with the right support and opportunity, JAHmere can work \nthrough his grief in healthy ways and return to being the kind, helpful, positive presence we've \nknown him to be.\nBrandon would want his best friend to have the chance to honor his memory by living well, not \nby having his life derailed by one mistake made in the fog of grief. We share that hope.\nThank you for considering this perspective on JAHmere's character and circumstances.\nSincerely,\n \nLindsey McKenna \nWesley Chapel \n(619) 723-9347 \nTampa, FL 33602\nlindseymckenna2001@gmail.com\n\"In memory of Brandon McKenna, who saw the best in everyone, especially his brother \nJAHmere.\"",

Twiggs Street \nTampa, FL 33602\nRE: Character Reference for JAHmere Webb\nDear Judge Ferrero,\nMy name is Reggie Hutcherson, and I am writing this letter to provide a character reference for \nJAHmere Webb. I have known JAHmere for over 20 years and I can confidently say that he is a \ngentle giant with a kind heart and a great sense of humor. JAHmere is someone who loves to \nhave fun and enjoys life, especially as a devoted fan of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. More \nimportantly, he is deeply committed to his family.\nOur Relationship and History\nI first met JAHmere over two decades ago [specific context if you can provide - through work, \nneighborhood, church, etc.]. Throughout these 20+ years, I have had the opportunity to observe \nJAHmere in many different situations - celebrating successes, facing challenges, and navigating \nthe ups and downs of life. This long history has given me deep insight into his true character.\nWhat has always struck me about JAHmere is his consistent kindness, even when life has been \ndifficult. The nickname \"gentle giant\" perfectly captures his nature - while he may be physically \nimposing, his first instinct is always to help rather than harm, to bring people together rather than \ncreate division. His sense of humor has been a constant throughout our friendship, often \ndiffusing tense situations and bringing joy to those around him.\nJAHmere's Character and Values\nFamily Dedication: JAHmere's commitment to his family has been unwavering throughout the \nyears I've known him. He consistently puts family needs before his own and takes his \n\nresponsibilities seriously. [If you have specific examples of how he's supported family members, \nthis would be valuable to include].\nCommunity Presence: In our community, JAHmere is known as someone you can count on. \nWhether it's helping a neighbor with a task or being there when someone needs support, he has \nshown up consistently over the years. His loyalty - evident even in his decades-long support of \nthe Tampa Bay Buccaneers through good seasons and bad - extends to his relationships with \npeople.\nPersonal Growth: Over the 20 years I've known JAHmere, I've watched him mature and grow \nas a person. He has learned from his experiences and consistently tried to be a better version of \nhimself. This journey hasn't always been easy, but he has persevered.\nUnderstanding the Current Situation\nJAHmere has made some mistakes, and while I do not wish to excuse his actions, I believe it is \nimportant to recognize that this is out of character for him. Throughout the time I have known \nhim, JAHmere has consistently demonstrated integrity, kindness, and responsibility. He is \nsomeone who learns from his mistakes and strives to be better, but sometimes life just doesn't go \nthe way he wants.\nI have spoken with JAHmere about his current situation, and I can see his genuine remorse. He \nunderstands the seriousness of his actions and their impact on others. This understanding, \ncombined with the strong foundation of character I've observed over 20 years, gives me \nconfidence that he will use this experience as an opportunity for positive change.\nMy Ongoing Support\nYour Honor, my support for JAHmere extends beyond this letter. I am committed to:\n•Being available for regular check-ins and accountability\n•Providing encouragement and guidance as he moves forward\n•Helping him stay connected to positive influences in our community\n•Supporting his efforts to make amends and contribute positively\nI am part of a network of friends and family who stand ready to support JAHmere through this \ndifficult time and beyond. We believe in his ability to learn from this experience and become an \neven better member of our community.\nRequest for Consideration\nEveryone deserves a second chance, especially those like JAHmere who show genuine remorse \nand a willingness to improve. I believe that with support and understanding, JAHmere will use \nthis experience as a stepping stone to grow and continue contributing positively to his \ncommunity and family.\n\nGiven JAHmere's genuine nature and positive contributions to those around him over the past 20 \nyears, I sincerely hope that any penalties imposed can be transformed to building bridges of hope \nfor his future. He is a valuable member of his family and community, and I am confident that he \nwill take this opportunity to transform, grow and improve.\nYour Honor, I respectfully ask that you consider the whole person that JAHmere is - not just this \nmoment of poor judgment, but the two decades of positive relationships, family dedication, and \ncommunity presence that define him. With the right support and opportunity, I believe JAHmere \ncan turn this setback into a setup for positive change that benefits not just himself, but others who \nmay be facing similar challenges.\nThank you for your time and consideration in reviewing this character reference. I stand ready to \nanswer any questions you may have about JAHmere's character or my observations over our 20-\nyear friendship.\nRespectfully submitted,\n \nReggie Hutcherson \nManager, State Farm \n(813) 505-1596\nreggiehutcherson@gmail.com",

Ferrero \nHillsborough County Courthouse \n800 E. Twiggs Street \nTampa, FL 33602\nRE: Character Reference for JAHmere Webb\nTo Whom It May Concern,\nMy name is Teresa Chantay Butler, and I am a longtime family friend of JAHmere Webb. I have \nknown JAHmere for over twenty years and consider him like a nephew. It is with sincerity and \nconfidence that I write this character reference on his behalf.\nA Two-Decade Perspective\nThroughout the time I've known JAHmere, I've watched him grow from a young boy into a \nrespectful, hardworking, and thoughtful adult. Twenty years provides a unique vantage point—\nI've seen JAHmere through childhood innocence, teenage challenges, young adult struggles, and \nhis journey toward maturity. This long-term perspective allows me to speak not just to moments, \nbut to patterns; not just to incidents, but to character.\nWhen I say I consider JAHmere like a nephew, I mean that I've been present for his life in the \nway family is—through good times and difficult ones, through achievements and setbacks. I've \nwatched him at family gatherings, community events, and in quiet everyday moments. What has \nremained constant throughout these two decades is his fundamental decency and his desire to do \nright by those he cares about.\nUnderstanding Growth Through Adversity\nI do understand the seriousness of his charges from 2013. However, over the past ten years in \nparticular, he has demonstrated extraordinary personal growth and maturity. He has taken \n\nmeaningful steps to better himself and consistently shows responsibility and dedication in his \nactions.\nWhat I've witnessed over this past decade is not just the passage of time, but genuine \ntransformation. The JAHmere of 2013 was still finding his way, still learning hard lessons about \nchoices and consequences. The JAHmere of today is someone who has internalized those \nlessons, who has done the difficult work of self-examination and change.\nThis growth hasn't been abstract—it's been visible in concrete ways:\n•In how he approaches responsibilities with seriousness rather than avoidance\n•In how he considers consequences before acting rather than acting impulsively\n•In how he seeks to build rather than destroy\n•In how he takes ownership of his past while working toward a better future\nThe Quiet Integrity I've Witnessed\nJAHmere carries himself with quiet integrity. He treats those around him with kindness and \nrespect, and he values the importance of making positive choices. This isn't loud or performative \ngoodness—it's the steady, consistent kind that shows up in small daily decisions and interactions.\nHis commitment to self-improvement is evident not just in words but in how he now lives his \ndaily life. I've watched him:\n•Make difficult choices to distance himself from negative influences\n•Pursue work opportunities with dedication and reliability\n•Maintain family relationships even when it required effort and sacrifice\n•Choose patience and thoughtfulness over quick reactions\nThis quiet integrity is perhaps most evident in how he doesn't make excuses for his past. He \nowns his mistakes while demonstrating through actions that they don't define his future.\nMy Appeal to the Court\nI understand the serious nature of court proceedings and do not take this letter lightly. I fully and \ntruly believe that JAHmere is someone of good character who is learning from life's challenges \nand is continuing to stay on a positive path as he maneuvers through his challenges.\nYour Honor, twenty years of observation has shown me that JAHmere's current situation \nrepresents a departure from the trajectory of growth and positive change I've witnessed, \nparticularly over the past decade. The young man who made mistakes in 2013 has evolved into \nsomeone who understands the weight of choices, the value of integrity, and the importance of \ncontributing positively to his community.\nOngoing Support and Belief\n\nIf you require any more information, I am more than willing to speak further on JAHmere's \nbehalf. As someone who has watched him grow from boyhood to manhood, I can provide \nadditional perspective on his character development, his family values, and his genuine desire to \nbe a positive force in the world.\nJudge Ferrero, I ask you to consider not just this moment, but the broader arc of JAHmere's life\n—the consistent growth, the lessons learned, the maturity gained, and the positive contributions \nhe's capable of making. After twenty years of knowing him, I can say with confidence that \nJAHmere Webb is someone worth investing in, not giving up on.\nThe boy I met twenty years ago has become a man who understands responsibility, values \nrelationships, and seeks to make amends for past mistakes while building a better future. That \ntransformation, witnessed over two decades, speaks to his true character far more than any single \nincident.\nThank you for your time and consideration in reviewing this long-term perspective on \nJAHmere's character.\nWarm regards,\n \nTeresa Chantay Butler \nFamily Friend of 20+ Years \n386-538-9911 \nswayona@icloud.com\n\"Twenty years of watching someone grow provides a perspective that transcends any single \nmoment.

Ferrero \nHillsborough County Courthouse \n800 E. Twiggs Street \nTampa, FL 33602\nRE: Character Reference for JAHmere Webb\nDear Judge Ferrero,\nMr. Bravetto JAHmere is a fine young man. He has demonstrated his character for years since he \nbeen in and out of school. He has displayed honesty and honor in the community and while \nattending church service which he attended twice a week monthly for years.\nA Foundation of Faith and Character\nThroughout the years I've known JAHmere, his commitment to spiritual growth has been \nremarkable. His twice-weekly church attendance wasn't just about showing up—it was about \ngenuine engagement with his faith community. He participated actively in services, connected \nwith fellow members, and consistently demonstrated the values we hold dear: honesty, honor, \nand service to others.\nWhat struck me most about JAHmere's presence in our church was his authenticity. In a world \nwhere many young people drift away from faith communities, JAHmere chose to be present, to \nlearn, and to grow. His regular attendance spoke volumes about his desire to ground himself in \npositive values and supportive community.\nThe Impact of His Presence\nSeveral people would speak of his excellent behavior. This wasn't just polite church behavior—\nthis was genuine character shining through. JAHmere had a way of making everyone feel \nwelcomed and valued. Whether greeting elderly members, helping with church activities, or \nsimply being a positive presence, he consistently demonstrated respect and kindness.\n\nThe consistency of his character across different settings—in the community and at church—\nshowed that his good behavior wasn't performative. It was simply who he is. Young people in our \ncongregation looked up to him, and adults appreciated his respectful demeanor and willingness \nto help whenever needed.\nHis Absence Is Felt\nEvery week I still attend the church and membership ask me about JAHmere. The frequency of \nthese inquiries speaks to the positive impact he had on our faith community. People don't ask \nabout those who merely occupied space—they ask about those who made a difference.\n\"Is JAHmere still the same as he was before—high character?\" they ask me. This question \nreveals their hope that the young man they knew and respected hasn't changed at his core. They \nremember someone of high character, and they hope that remains true despite whatever \nchallenges he may be facing.\nThey ask me what exactly is he doing, and they miss not seeing him. These aren't casual \ninquiries—these are people who genuinely care about JAHmere's wellbeing and miss his \npresence in our community. A church family notices when one of their own is absent, especially \nsomeone who contributed positively to our spiritual environment.\nMaintaining Connection Despite Distance\nJAHmere now lives in Tampa, which explains his physical absence from our church. However, \ndistance hasn't diminished the impression he left on our congregation. The fact that people \ncontinue to ask about him shows the lasting positive impact he made during his years of faithful \nattendance and service.\nMy Appeal to the Court\nWell, I pray I sent you information so you know about JAHmere. The young man I knew in our \nchurch community was someone committed to growth, dedicated to serving others, and \nconsistent in demonstrating high character. His years of faithful church attendance, twice weekly \nfor extended periods, show discipline and commitment that many lack.\nYour Honor, I ask you to consider the JAHmere that our church community knows:\n•A young man who chose faith over other paths\n•Someone who attended services faithfully for years\n•A person whose character impressed an entire congregation\n•An individual whose absence is still felt and questioned\nThis consistent pattern of positive behavior over years within our faith community speaks to his \ntrue character. Whatever current challenges he faces, I believe they don't erase the years of \ndemonstrated integrity, service, and spiritual commitment that defined his time with us.\n\nI pray that this perspective helps you see JAHmere as we saw him—a young man of faith and \ncharacter who positively impacted everyone around him. Our church community stands ready to \nwelcome him back and support his continued growth and rehabilitation.\nThank you for considering this testament to JAHmere's character from his faith community. We \nbelieve in redemption, in second chances, and in the power of community support to help \nindividuals overcome challenges and return to the positive path they once walked.\nSincerely,\n \nTracy Henderson \nGainesville, Fl \n(352) 301-1836 \njahweb2@gmail.com\n\"Faith communities remember those who serve with genuine hearts. JAHmere's service and \ncharacter left an indelible mark on our congregation.\"",
