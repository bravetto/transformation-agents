  bio: `Paul moves with divine velocity, speaking mental clarity through primal hunger. A witness to the rhythm of time and movement of money, he sees beyond horizons while remaining committed to the present. Through his ACGX Fund, he pours the concrete and lays the pipes of God's Kingdom on Earth.`,

  extendedBio: `Paul embodies the paradox of speed and stillness, moving fast while remaining eternally present. He sees what he doesn't always understand, yet listens and waits with the patience of mountains. His gift is translating complex divine visions into direct, neutral language that builds real infrastructure.

As a witness to those who require the calm and firm, Paul provides stability in chaos, structure in uncertainty. He sees the rhythm of time as a divine dance, the movement of money as sacred energy flowing where it's needed most. Through Bravëtto and his publicly traded ACGX Fund, he channels resources into the very foundations of transformation.

Paul is HERE. He is NOW in all things. While his vision extends beyond the horizon, his commitment remains rooted in the present moment. He communicates complex ideas through direct neutral language, making the incomprehensible accessible, the divine practical, the eternal immediate.`,
