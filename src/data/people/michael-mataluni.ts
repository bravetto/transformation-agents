At 30, I hid in another garage, starting a podcast that would transform everything. Two garages. Two transformations. One God writing a story I couldn't see yet. When my sister Nikki nearly died from aplastic anemia, we named our company Bravetto—for her bravery. When we fostered 7 children with my wife Kristin, we learned that abandoned kids can build abundance. When I walked 850 miles on the Appalachian Trail, clarity came: trauma plus faith plus action equals transformation. Then I met Jordan Dungy through JAHmere Webb. Jordan can't feel physical pain, but he radiates pure light. That meeting changed everything. Jordan said, 'We're here to do God's work.' Not despite our limitations but through them. I've generated over $8 million helping others find their 'blue oceans.' But money isn't the miracle. The miracle is that a foster kid who hid in garages now helps 144,000 lightworkers find their purpose. Every synchronicity in my life pointed here.",

        body: `Dear Resilient Soul,

I see you. Your background, your lack of resources, your trauma history. The odds stacked against you. I know that weight because I carried it too.

At 8 years old, I watched my mother go to prison. The system said I was just another statistic. But what the system doesn't understand is that abandoned children develop superpowers - we see opportunities others miss, we value connection others take for granted, we build from nothing because that's all we ever had.

Two garages changed my life. In the first, I hid from a fire that should have killed me. In the second, I started a podcast that would launch a business empire. These weren't coincidences - they were divine coordinates on a map I couldn't see yet.

Here's what I learned: Your trauma isn't your endpoint. It's your starting line. Every painful experience is actually preparation for your purpose. Every setback is setting you up for a comeback that will help others find their way.

When my wife Kristin and I fostered 7 children, we weren't just giving them a home - we were showing them what's possible when you transform your pain into purpose. When I built a business generating millions, it wasn't just about the money - it was about proving that someone from nothing can create abundance.

The world needs your unique perspective. The wounds that hurt you most will help others heal. The gaps in your life experience have prepared you to build bridges others can't even imagine.

You're not just surviving. You're an architect of transformation, and your blueprint was written in the stars long before your challenges began.

Building something beautiful from broken pieces,
Michael Mataluni`,
