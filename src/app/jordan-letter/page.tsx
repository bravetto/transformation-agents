                    Our justice system has become numb to its own dysfunction.
                    It can't feel the pain it's causing, so it keeps causing
                    more. JAHmere is the nerve ending that's still firing. He's
                    the pain signal saying "SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE."

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    I live every day knowing that what doesn't hurt me could
                    kill me. I've learned to rely on others to tell me when I'm
                    in danger. To trust their pain signals when mine don't work.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4 text-xl">
                    JAHmere is society's pain signal. He's telling us the system
                    is burning, cutting, breaking people. We can ignore him like
                    I might ignore a flame under my hand, or we can listen and
                    pull back before more damage is done.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Dad, you taught me that God doesn't make mistakes. My
                    inability to feel pain has a purpose - it made me an expert
                    at seeing it in others. JAHmere's decade of pain has a
                    purpose too - it qualified him to prevent it.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Judge Ferrero, you have a choice. Add more pain to a system
                    already screaming, or try something different. Be the judge
                    who heard the pain and prescribed purpose.

                  <p className="text-xl font-bold">
                    I can't feel physical pain, but I promise you - watching
                    JAHmere's potential die in a cell while kids who need him
                    fall through the same cracks would be the kind of pain even
                    I could feel.
