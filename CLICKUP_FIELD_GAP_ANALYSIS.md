## üí° Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Add Custom Fields to ClickUp (Recommended)
You can add these custom fields to your ClickUp CRM list:

1. **Behavior Tracking Fields:**
   - Pages Visited (Text or Multiselect)
   - Time on Site (Number field in minutes)
   - Stories Read (Text or Multiselect)

2. **Conversion Fields:**
   - Letter Submitted (Checkbox)
   - Volunteer Signup (Checkbox)
   - Willing to Testify (Checkbox)

3. **Lifecycle Fields:**
   - Lead Score (Number field)
   - Last Engagement (Date field)

### Option 2: Use ClickUp Tags
- Create tags for: `letter-submitted`, `volunteer`, `willing-to-testify`
- This would be cleaner than storing in keywords

### Option 3: Use ClickUp Comments/Activity
- Track page visits and story reads in task comments
- Use ClickUp's native activity tracking for engagement

## üéØ Impact on Current Integration

The current integration handles the missing fields by:
1. **Concatenating** relationship info into keywords/product description
2. **Checking keywords** for boolean fields (letter_submitted, volunteer, testify)
3. **Using ClickUp's updatedAt** instead of custom lastEngagement
4. **Not tracking** behavior data (pagesVisited, timeOnSite, storiesRead, leadScore)

## üöÄ Next Steps

To fully support all Bridge Project fields, you should:

1. **Add custom fields in ClickUp** for the missing data points
2. **Update the field mapping** in `clickup-field-mapping.ts`
3. **Modify the data transformation** functions to use the new fields

Would you like me to:
- Generate a script to add these custom fields to ClickUp?
- Update the integration to use tags instead of keywords?
- Create a separate tracking system for behavior data?
