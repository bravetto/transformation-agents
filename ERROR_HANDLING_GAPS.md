# Error Handling Gap Analysis

## 🔴 Immediate Risks (Fix This Week)

### 1. Build System Errors
- **Component**: webpack/framer-motion vendor chunks
- **Issue**: ENOENT errors preventing successful builds
- **Impact**: Cannot deploy to production
- **Solution**: Fix webpack configuration and clean build cache

### 2. Missing Error Boundaries in Critical Routes
- **Component**: Most app routes except root
- **Issue**: Only `/app/error.tsx` exists at root level
- **Impact**: Unhandled errors crash entire pages

| Route | Has error.tsx | Priority | Business Impact |
|-------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| `/people` | ❌ | HIGH | Core user-facing feature |
| `/contact` | ❌ | HIGH | User data collection |
| `/impact` | ❌ | HIGH | Analytics dashboard |
| `/the-case` | ❌ | MEDIUM | Content page |
| `/admin/*` | ❌ | MEDIUM | Admin functionality |

### 3. Animation Components Without Error Handling
- **Component**: `divine-particles.tsx`
- **Issue**: No try-catch for tsParticles initialization
- **Impact**: Performance crashes on low-end devices
- **Current Protection**: Has `withDivineErrorBoundary` HOC but needs internal error handling

### 4. Form Components Missing Validation States
- **Component**: `divine-letter-form.tsx`
- **Issue**: Limited error state handling for API failures
- **Impact**: Users lose form data on errors
- **Current Protection**: Has error boundary but needs better UX for errors

## 🟡 Short-term Improvements (Next 2 Weeks)

### 1. Component Error Handling Coverage
| Component Type | Current Coverage | Target | Gap |
|----------------|------------------|--------|-----|
| Divine Components | 60% | 85% | 25% |
| Forms | 40% | 90% | 50% |
| Animations | 30% | 80% | 50% |
| API Routes | 85% | 95% | 10% |

### 2. Missing Loading States
- **Areas**: Async data fetching in people pages
- **Enhancement**: Add proper Suspense boundaries
- **Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)

### 3. Test Coverage Gaps
| Area | Current | Target | Critical Tests Missing |
|------|---------|--------|------------------------|
| Divine Particles | 5% | 70% | Performance under load, error recovery |
| Letter Forms | 10% | 80% | Validation, network failures |
| ClickUp Integration | 15% | 75% | API failures, rate limiting |
| People Pages | 30% | 70% | Loading states, 404 handling |

## 🟢 Coverage Progression Plan

### Week 1: 45% → 65%
1. Fix webpack build errors
2. Add error.tsx to 5 critical routes
3. Add try-catch to divine-particles
4. Implement form error recovery

### Week 2: 65% → 80%
1. Expand error boundaries to remaining routes
2. Add loading.tsx to async routes
3. Implement resilient network layer
4. Add basic chaos tests

### Month 1: 80% → 90%
1. Complete error boundary coverage
2. Add performance monitoring
3. Implement circuit breakers
4. Full integration test suite
