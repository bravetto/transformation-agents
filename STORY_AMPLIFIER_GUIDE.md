## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

### Core Components
The system consists of:

1. **`StoryAmplifier`**: The main component rendering the enhanced story
2. **`StoryContent` interface**: Data structure for story content and metadata
3. **Demo components**: For showcasing and testing functionality

### Integration Path

To implement the Story Amplifier in an existing page:

1. **Import the component**:
   ```typescript
   import StoryAmplifier from '@/components/story-amplifier'
   import type { StoryContent } from '@/components/story-amplifier'
   ```

2. **Prepare story data**:
   ```typescript
   const storyData: StoryContent = {
     id: 'unique-id',
     title: 'Story Title',
     content: 'Story content...',
     // Complete all required fields
   }
   ```

3. **Render the component**:
   ```typescript
   <StoryAmplifier 
     story={storyData}
     onShare={(platform) => {
       // Handle share events
     }}
     onCallToAction={() => {
       // Handle CTA clicks
     }}
   />
   ```

### Required Data Structure

The `StoryContent` interface requires:

- Basic story information (title, content, author)
- SEO metadata (title, description, keywords)
