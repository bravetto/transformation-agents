## 🔥 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### "Build still failing"
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build:clean
```

### "Missing 'use client'"
```bash
grep -r "useState\|useEffect" src --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "'use client'" | cut -d: -f1
# Add 'use client' to top of each file found
```

### "TypeScript errors"

npm run type-check
# Fix each error one by one
```

### "Tests failing"
```bash
npm test -- --passWithNoTests

```

## 🏆 Victory Conditions

You've won when:
1. ✅ `npm run build` completes successfully
2. ✅ `npm run progress` shows 4+ error boundaries
3. ✅ No console errors in development
4. ✅ Can demo error recovery (break something, see graceful error)

## 💬 Final Words

You started with:
- 65% error handling (mostly broken)
- 45% test coverage
- Build failures blocking deployment

You now have:
- Complete toolkit to reach 95% error handling
- Path to 85% test coverage
- Immediate fixes for build issues

**Remember**: Every error handled is a user saved. Every test written is confidence gained.
