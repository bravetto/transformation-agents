# Performance Optimization Guide
> The Bridge Project - Performance Best Practices

## Overview
This guide documents our performance optimization efforts for The Bridge Project, providing guidelines for maintaining high performance across the entire codebase. Our optimizations focus on reducing unnecessary renders, optimizing expensive calculations, and ensuring smooth animations across all devices.

## Key Optimization Areas

### 1. Component Memoization

We've implemented React.memo for pure components to prevent unnecessary re-renders:

```tsx
// Before: Component re-renders on every parent render
function MyComponent({ data }) {
  // ...
}

// After: Component only re-renders when props change
const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent({ data }) {
  // ...
});

// Add display name for better debugging
MyComponent.displayName = 'MyComponent';
```

**When to use React.memo:**
- For pure components that render frequently
- For components with expensive rendering operations
- For components that receive complex props
- For components that rarely need to update

**When NOT to use React.memo:**
- For components that almost always re-render anyway
- For very simple components where memoization overhead exceeds benefits
- For components with frequently changing props

### 2. Hook Optimization

We've optimized hooks usage with proper dependency arrays and memoization:

```tsx
// Before: Function recreated on every render
const handleClick = () => {
  // ...
};

// After: Function cached and only recreated when dependencies change
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  // ...
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);

// Before: Value recalculated on every render
const filteredData = data.filter(item => item.active);

// After: Value only recalculated when dependencies change
const filteredData = useMemo(() => {
  return data.filter(item => item.active);
}, [data]);
```

**Best practices:**
- Always specify dependencies accurately in useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
- Memoize callback functions passed as props with useCallback
- Consider the cost of calculation vs. memoization overhead

### 3. Rendering Optimization

We've implemented efficient rendering patterns:

```tsx
// Optimized list rendering with memoization
const renderList = useMemo(() => {
  return items.map(item => (
    <ListItem 
      key={item.id}
      data={item}
    />
  ));
}, [items]);

// Using fragments to avoid unnecessary DOM nodes
return (
  <>
    <Header />
    {renderList}
    <Footer />
  </>
);
```

**Best practices:**
- Avoid inline object and array creation in render
- Use proper keys for list items (not index when order can change)
- Split large components into smaller, focused ones
- Implement virtualization for long lists
- Avoid anonymous functions in render when possible

### 4. Animation Performance

We've optimized animations for better performance:

```tsx
// Optimized animation with hardware acceleration
<motion.div
  className="transform-gpu will-change-transform"
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.4 }}
>
  {children}
</motion.div>
```

**Best practices:**
- Use CSS transforms instead of layout properties when possible
- Enable hardware acceleration for animations
- Implement reduced motion support for accessibility
- Conditionally disable animations on low-performance devices
- Use requestAnimationFrame for custom animations

### 5. Code Splitting

We've implemented code splitting for better initial load times:

```tsx
// Dynamically import heavy components
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <LoadingPlaceholder />,
  ssr: false // Disable server-side rendering if not needed
});
```

**Best practices:**
- Split code at route level (automatic in Next.js App Router)
- Dynamically import heavy libraries and components
- Use suspense boundaries for loading states
- Implement proper loading states for async components

## Project-Specific Optimizations

### Memoized Components
- **GridView**: Prevents re-renders when parent changes but grid data doesn't
- **PersonCard**: Optimizes card rendering in lists
- **MetricCard**: Improves dashboard performance
- **PageTransition**: Prevents animation recalculation

### Optimized Calculations
- Person attribute derivation functions in `interactive-person-grid.tsx`
- Filter operations in complex data grids
- Animation configurations in transition components

### Animation Optimizations
- Battery and performance-aware animations with `AnimationContext`
- Reduced motion support across all animated components
- Hardware-accelerated transforms with CSS classes

## Monitoring Performance

- Use React DevTools Profiler to identify unnecessary renders
- Use Performance tab in Chrome DevTools to measure rendering time
- Use Lighthouse for overall performance scoring
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in production

## Implementation Checklist

When implementing new components or features, use this checklist:

- [ ] Identify pure components that should be memoized with React.memo
- [ ] Use useCallback for event handlers passed as props
- [ ] Use useMemo for expensive calculations
- [ ] Implement proper dependency arrays in hooks
- [ ] Split large components into smaller, focused ones
- [ ] Consider code splitting for heavy components
- [ ] Test performance on lower-end devices
- [ ] Ensure animations respect reduced motion preferences
- [ ] Use virtualization for long lists

## Conclusion

Performance optimization is an ongoing process. By following these guidelines, we maintain a fast, responsive experience for all users of The Bridge Project, regardless of their device capabilities.
