# The Greatness Zone Assessment System

## Overview

The Greatness Zone, developed by Jay Forte, is a comprehensive talent assessment system that helps individuals discover their unique intersection of Passions, Talents, and Values - the sweet spot where personal excellence meets world impact.

## Core Components

### 1. Venn Diagram Structure
The Greatness Zone is visualized as a Venn diagram with three overlapping circles:
- **Passions**: What you love to do
- **Talents**: What you're naturally good at
- **Values**: What matters most to you

The intersection of these three elements creates your "Greatness Zone" - where your greatest joy meets the world's greatest needs.

### 2. Performance Quadrants
The assessment measures performance across four key quadrants:
- **Directing** (Top)
- **Thinking** (Right)
- **Supporting** (Bottom)
- **Feeling** (Left)

### 3. Performance Personalities
Each individual is mapped to specific roles within these quadrants:
- **Emcee**: Directing/Feeling
- **Chairman**: Directing/Thinking
- **Professor**: Thinking/Supporting
- **Friend**: Supporting/Feeling
